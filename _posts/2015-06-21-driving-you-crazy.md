summary: I drove to Portland this weekend and ate jam in a traffic jam. This is not a perfect synopsis.
---
I'd like to be naturally amazing at pretty much everything (I'd take [the orange pill][ssc] hands down), but driving is one I'm trying to prioritise. It's never been easy for me to make time for it - it took me 5 years to get the 120 hours of supervised driving that Sydney requires because I just never drive anywhere. 

(Which is the story of how I got my [Red P's][P1] 5 days before I moved to Seattle and hence the first time I drove by myself was on the <strike>right</strike> wrong side of the road).

I'm a habitual pedestrian (I don't even own a car), so half the battle for me with driving is just carving out the time to practice. Weekly singing lessons mean I have the regularity thing down - I get about 2 hours in each week, where I generally focus on deliberately doing the basics well (speed limits, scanning, noticing/observing signage, etc) - but I always see huge step improvements with raodtrips.

So it was great that Andrew and I drove down to Portland this weekend :) My focus for this trip was on lane positioning, highway driving and parking (sorry for swearing so much Andrew). I tend to see step improvements in my driving skills after long trips, so I'm glad we made time to do this.

I drove ~10 hours this weekend, but I struggle to feel proud about it because it's just an action rather than a process establishing future actions. But my meta-level issues can wait for another post :)
