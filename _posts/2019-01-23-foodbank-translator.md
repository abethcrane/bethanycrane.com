So where are we at with foodbank?


Visit to the place!!
Notes:

Next time set up the translator subscription keys  
Docuement of instructions + in the app somewhere (maybe a tutorial?)
App crashes if you don't have wifi
Seems like image outputing doesn't always work
Little old ladies need big big fonts
4 staff on site and share 3 with the senior center - van driver, food bank  manager, volunteer coordinater, warehouse coordinator 
Past few years has increased focus on customer service and being super welcoming 
An example of a weird food: wtf is lemon tumeric hummus ??
Print outs are mostly for reference 
Serve 100 people an hour . Many volunteers eg 4 in produce 2 in dairy 
Figure out signs that each section needs beforehand if possible but can't  always 
Signs are for volunteers not stuck up on items
