Hi, I'm Beth. I go through phases where I blog a lot, and phases where I write notes in my phone but never expand upon them, and phases where all my deep thoughts get sent out into the abyss on snapchat. This is the documentation of that first phase.

A collection of miscellaneous Beth!facts, for your reading pleasure:
- I once broke a karaoke system due to a habit of putting the sparkle emoji ✨ in my usernames
- My current favorite lip balm is probably either the [Blistex Complete Moisture][blistex] or the [Beekman 1802 Vanilla Absolute][beekman]
- I spent a pleasant vacation day in Sydney learning emojicode and sometimes wish it were more a part of my life
- Blink-182 played What's My Age Again on my 23rd birthday and probably no concert will ever live up to it
- I think about Dune when I'm getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist
- My friends made me a giant paper maché spoon for my 13th birthday, in homage to Terry Pratchett's quote about Hope in Going Postal
- I have a degree in Computer Science from UNSW, but also an unofficial minor in Linguistics - why unofficial? Because they removed the concept of minors from Science Degrees, citing it as 'confusing'
