I bought my first DSLR at the start of 2012, and never looked back. You can find my favorite work on [flickr][flickr]. I run a fashion/interview blog called [Fibonacci Sequins][fibseq], which is what most of my portrait photography goes towards. Please reach out if you know someone who'd be fun to profile ðŸ˜„

I found my first retro polaroid (an Image 1200) at a GoodWill in 2017 and after it was stolen I upgraded to a restored slr-680. I adore the way my polaroid makes me think twice before shooting, and how it feels like the best souvenir of a trip. You might find some of the snaps over in the Projects category.

My [instagram][insta] is mostly day-to-day, sometimes from a DSLR, mostly from my phone (perhaps with a Moment lens or from my Snapchat Spectacles).
